title: "The Pragmatist"
---


Back-end development keeps me energized! Whether it's wielding the power of PHP (my go-to language!) or exploring the possibilities of GoLang, I'm always learning and pushing boundaries. Add DevOps and Linux management to the mix, and I'm in my happy place, ensuring smooth deployments and a well-oiled infrastructure.

However, I don't shy away from the front-end! My skills in frameworks like Vue.js and React allow me to build user-friendly interfaces that complement the back-end seamlessly. Data management is another area where I excel, allowing me to create well-organized and efficient applications.

Leadership and problem-solving are at the core of my approach. Leading a team to launch JeyServer.com (check it out!) further honed these abilities.

If you're looking for a versatile developer who excels in back-end development, DevOps, and can contribute to the front-end, let's connect!

**IOT Full-Stack Software Developer (Contractor) - Hinics (Apr - Nov 2023)**

- Collaborated with [Hinics](https://www.hinics.com/), an electronics company, to develop a smart and internet-connected relay capable of controlling other devices based on various conditions such as time, temperature, humidity, and manual actions.
- Designed the device using ESP8266 and created a mobile app for device management via WiFi-Direct, internet, or SMS.
- Developed an online dashboard for device owners to monitor and manage their devices, with additional support for sales and support teams.
- Wrote ESP8266 firmware using modern C++ code and contributed [some libraries](https://registry.platformio.org/search?q=owner%3Ayeganemehr) to the PlatformIO repository as open source.
- Developed the mobile application using Vue.js and Cordova, and server backend using Swoole and Laravel to create both RESTful API and a Protobuf-based websocket API.
- Integrated SMS800 for receiving commands from the app and sending responses.

**Full-Stack Developer (Contractor) - Egerd (Apr - Oct 2022)**

* Contracted as a Full-Stack Developer at [Egerd](https://egerd.com), tasked with optimizing website performance and implementing efficient development practices.
* Received projects with components written in Python (Django), JavaScript (Express) for backend, and Next.js for the frontend, without any documentation or support from previous developers.
* Successfully optimized website performance, reducing load time from over 50 seconds to less than 3 seconds.
* Dockerized the project for improved deployment and management.
* Implemented CI/CD using GitHub Actions and extensively documented processes for future team members.
* Streamlined server infrastructure, reducing resource requirements from a 32-core CPU, 2 NVMe disks, and 64 GB of RAM to a modest 4 GB RAM and 2 core setup, resulting in significant cost savings.

**Project Lead and Developer - DChat (2012 - 2014)**
